Here are placed Dockerfiles for different runtimes used by ETL build.
In each runtime package there is `Makefile` that should be used to build and push the images.

Current list of runtimes:
* Python:
  * `runtime_python:3.8v2` -> `python3.8` is used.
  * `runtime_python:3.10v2` -> `python3.10` is used.
  * `runtime_python:3.11v2` -> `python3.11` is used.
