Here are placed Dockerfiles for different runtimes used by ETL build.
In each runtime package there is `Makefile` that should be used to build and push the images.

Current list of runtimes:
* Python:
  * `runtime_python:2` -> `python2.7.18` is used.
  * `runtime_python:3` -> `python3.8.5` is used.
  * `runtime_python:3.6` -> `python3.6` is used.
  * `runtime_python:3.8` -> `python3.8` is used.
  * `runtime_python:3.10` -> `python3.10` is used.
